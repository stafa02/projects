"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

I used a hashmap to store preferences and allocated courses for each student,
where key is student id and value is list of courses. I used it mainly because
it provides O(1) put/get in the average case.
I used a list to store registration times to maintain them in a sorted order,
as we need to consider students on a fcfs basis.
